# Airsoft Cabinet âœ¨

> [!WARNING]  
> **! Project still in development**

In this project, I will create a cabinet to store Airsoft equipment such as guns, clothing, MAGs. I will be using components like a Raspberry Pi Zero, a mini air compressor, pneumatic components, and a Touch LCD screen.

The purpose of this cabinet is to have a touch screen on the outside of the door, along with a biometric reader. When a successful biometric scan is performed, the system activates the air compressor. In turn, this action operates two pneumatic pistons controlled by pneumatic valves to open the two doors. After this, there will be a second screen inside the cabinet to close the doors automatically.

The entire project will feature a security system to detect obstacles during the door's opening and closing. It includes sensors on the pistons, a presence sensor with a delay, and pressure sensors throughout the pneumatic system.
